# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with BERT and Topic Modeling
## Description
A Python-based project leveraging BERT for sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. This project is designed to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands.

## Features
- **BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis**
Classifies text into five sentiment categories: Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, and Very Positive, using Hugging Face's pre-trained BERT model.
- **Topic Modeling with LDA**
Identifies underlying topics in the dataset, providing deeper insights into the themes of public discussions.
- **Entity-Level Analysis**
Analyzes sentiment and topics by specific entities (e.g., brands, products, or topics) for focused insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations**
Visualizes sentiment trends over time, sentiment distribution by topics, and entity-specific sentiment patterns.
- **Scalable and Flexible**
Easily adaptable to various social media datasets and customizable for different analysis needs.
- **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers (for BERT-based sentiment analysis)
- Gensim (for LDA-based topic modeling)
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- PyLDAvis (for interactive topic visualization)
